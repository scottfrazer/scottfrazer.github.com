-----------------------------------

I've been through a lot of personal web sites over the years.  Each seem to spring up into existence to debut something new that I've been learning and then slowly but surely fading away.  My last site, cognitivecow.com, was definitely the most successful so far.  It was up for 4 years and went through a redesign and still survived my transition out of college and into the working world.

That site was a bit rambling, though.  It covered everything from science to atheism to poetry to programming.  I didn't have focus and I didn't really care; it was fun and it was a place to show off some new stuff I was learning.  Though it did always bother me that the site came off as a personal hobby site more than a serious site.  I would even post Youtube videos of myself playing guitar on there from time to time.

My previous web sites haven't been complete losses, though.  Cognitivecow.com is my first site in which I have content that I still am very proud of.  I'll be importing the best of my previous articles over to scottfrazer.net when I get the time.

So here I am, a new domain and a new layout.  More importantly, a new focus:  I'm going to keep it technical and discuss the various projects and tech related problems that I'm working on.  This site should be like a resume.  In fact, I want the source code for this site to be an example of what I'm capable of in web development.  If you read enough of my site, you'll get a brain dump of what I know and what I'm interested in learning about in the field of software engineering.

My goal this time around is to just keep this going as long as I can.  I don't expect to post often but I do expect to post regularly.  I've also switched from self-hosting to hosting with github to prevent any technological issues with keeping the site up.

I'm still finishing up the design with what little time I have these days, but there should be more to come soon!
